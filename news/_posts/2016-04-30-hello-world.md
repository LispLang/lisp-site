# The Logo

Because Common Lisp was created by an organization, it never got an 'official'
logo. As a result, there are basically three logos in use in the wild: endless
variants of the letter lambda, the [Lisp salamander][salamander], and the
[Lisp alien][alien].

Now, the salamander is ugly and the alien's just not gonna cut it. Logos have to
be 1) beautiful and 2) simple, so they are easily remembered. The salamander
isn't the former and the alien isn't the latter.

But becacuse I'm not a graphic designer and good designers are expensive, I just
slapped together a lambda and a rounded square. It's an MVP, I guess.
