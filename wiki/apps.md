# StumpWM

Full article: [StumpWM](/wiki/stumpwm.html)

[StumpWM](https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm) is a tiling window manager written
entirely in Common Lisp, using the CLX library. It's not a minimalistic window
manager: It's goal is to be a hackable, Emacs-like,
everything-and-the-kitchen-sink (Maximalist, but not in the way GNOME and KDE)
are window manager.

The [`stumpwm-contrib`](https://github.com/stumpwm/stumpwm-contrib) repository
has community-contributed loadable modules.
