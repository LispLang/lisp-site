reasons:
  - title: Extensible
    desc: <a href="/wiki/reader-macros.html">Reader macros</a> allow new syntax
          (Decorators, list comprehensions) to be added to the language as
          libraries &ndash; portably &ndash; without modifying the
          implementation.
  - title: Fast
    desc: Gradual typing and type inference ensure the compiler generates the
          fastest possible code.
  - title: Mature and Stable
    desc:
  - title: Great Tools
    desc:
  - title: Ecosystem
    desc: Tons of readily available libraries, and
          <a href="https://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-projects/issues">
          plenty of new ones</a> on the waiting list. Look at our
          <a href="/wiki/recommended-libraries.html">favorites</a>.
  - title: Modules
    desc: Common Lisp's module system is explicit and beautiful, and lends
          itself to well-structured code on large codebases.
  - title: Concurrent
    desc: Parallelism, channel-based concurrency, async, STM, data parallelism
          &ndash; you name it, you have it.
  - title: CLOS
    desc: Common Lisp has a rich object system that solves
          <a href="/wiki/clos.html#benefits">most common pitfalls</a> of other
          object systems.
