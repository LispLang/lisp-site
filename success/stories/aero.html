            The screenshot shows our SigLab system running a simulation of an
            incoming nuclear warhead (all exo-atmospheric), and at 40 seconds
            into the run you see in the middle left 2-D Sonogram display the
            effects of a nearby warhead exploding and heating up the target
            being tracked. This analysis was used at Raytheon to develop
            advanced rapid detection and discrimination systems for targeting
            incoming nuclear warheads on our
            <a href="http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/ekv/">EKV project</a>
            (Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle).
