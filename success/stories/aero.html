        Piano is a complete aircraft analysis suite from <a href="http://www.piano.aero/">Lissys Ltd</a>.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Piano is a powerful commercial tool with an established user base of
          major airframe and aero-engine manufacturers, research and
          governmental institutions, and environmental organisations
          worldwide. Originally written in Macintosh Common Lisp, Piano has
          recently been ported to LispWorks and the user interface is now
          implemented using LispWorks CAPI graphical toolkit. The cross-platform
          capability of LispWorks proved to be an invaluable strength. The
          highly professional LispWorks team impressed Lissys from the start by
          rapidly prototyping some examples demonstrating the feasibility of
          such a complex transfer. The actual port was then carried out through
          Clozure Associates in a timeframe significantly better than our early
          expectations and resulting in a very stable final product.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the inception of Piano in the early 1990s, Lissys has used Lisp
          to support rapid development. The malleability of the language was a
          key factor when integrating the multifaceted and interdisciplinary
          aspects of aircraft project analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
          The flexibility of LispWorks also allowed us to create two separate
          tools, one that is fully-featured and largely intended for
          aeronautical engineers (Piano-5), and one that is freely downloadable
          and is addressed to a broader audience of anyone interested in
          aircraft evaluation with an emphasis on environmental emissions
          (Piano-X). A critical requirement for Piano-X was to provide a clean
          and simple interface on top of some highly complex underlying methods,
          a task that both LispWorks and Clozure handled admirably.
        </p>

        <p>
          In our experience, the straightforward licensing approach and
          technical professionalism of LispWorks stand out in the complex
          landscape of software development and create a highly effective
          combination.

    <h2>Missile Defense at Raytheon</h2>
    <p>
      Raytheon has built SigLab, a Common Lisp platform for signal processing
      used in missile defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      It combines high-performance FFTs and composable signal processing components.

            The screenshot shows our SigLab system running a simulation of an
            incoming nuclear warhead (all exo-atmospheric), and at 40 seconds
            into the run you see in the middle left 2-D Sonogram display the
            effects of a nearby warhead exploding and heating up the target
            being tracked. This analysis was used at Raytheon to develop
            advanced rapid detection and discrimination systems for targeting
            incoming nuclear warheads on our
            <a href="http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/ekv/">EKV project</a>
            (Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle).
