- title: ANSI Common Lisp
  author: Paul Graham
  cover: acl.jpg
  description: |

    [*ANSI Common Lisp*][acl] is a book for Lisp beginners. It has a nice
    example of writing a simple ray tracer in Common Lisp, and another (rather
    dated) example of using macros to generate HTML.

    >ANSI Common Lisp combines an introduction to Lisp programming, and a
    >convenient, up-to-date reference manual for ANSI Common Lisp. Beginners
    >will find that its careful explanations and interesting examples make Lisp
    >programming easy to learn. Professional programmers will appreciate its
    >thorough, practical approach.

- title: On Lisp
  author: Paul Graham
  cover: on-lisp.jpg
  description: |

    [*On Lisp*](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html) is "a comprehensive study
    of advanced Lisp techniques, with bottom-up programming as the unifying
    theme".

    >The book also covers important subjects related to bottom-up programming,
    >including functional programming, rapid prototyping, interactive
    >development, and embedded languages. The final chapter takes a deeper look
    >at object-oriented programming than previous Lisp books, showing the
    >step-by-step construction of a working model of the Common Lisp Object
    >System (CLOS).

    [*Land of Lisp*](http://landoflisp.com/) teaches Common Lisp by writing
    games. From the [publisher's description][land-pub]:

    >With his brilliantly quirky comics and out-of-this-world games, longtime
    >Lisper Conrad Barski teaches you the mysteries of Common Lisp. You'll start
    >with the basics, like list manipulation, I/O, and recursion, then move on
    >to more complex topics like macros, higher order programming, and
    >domain-specific languages. Then, when your brain overheats, you can kick
    >back with an action-packed comic book interlude!

- title: Let Over Lambda
  author: Doug Hoyte
  cover: lol.jpg
  description: |

    [*Let Over Lambda*][lol] is a book about advanced Common Lisp topics.

    From the author's description:

    >This book is about macros, that is programs that write programs. Macros are
    >what make lisp the greatest programming language in the world. When used
    >properly, macros enable amazing feats of abstraction, programmer
    >productivity, and code efficiency and security that are unheard of
    >elsewhere. Macros let you do things you simply cannot do in other
    >languages.

    >If you are looking for a dry coding manual that re-hashes common-sense
    >techniques in whatever langue du jour, this book is not for you. This book
    >is about pushing the boundaries of what we know about programming. While
    >this book teaches useful macro skills that can help solve your programming
    >problems today and now, it has also been designed to be entertaining and
    >inspiring. If you have ever wondered what lisp or even programming itself
    >is really about, this is the book you have been looking for.

- title: Professional Automated Trading
  author: Eugene Durenard
  cover: pat.jpg
  description: |

    [*Professional Automated Trading: Theory and Practice*][pat] uses Common
    Lisp to describe the implementation of automated trading systems.

    >Reflecting author Eugene Durenard's extensive experience in this field,
    >Professional Automated Trading offers valuable insights you won't find
    >anywhere else. It reveals how a series of concepts and techniques coming
    >from current research in artificial life and modern control theory can be
    >applied to the design of effective trading systems that outperform the
    >majority of published trading systems. It also skillfully provides you with
    >essential information on the practical coding and implementation of a
    >scalable systematic trading architecture.

- title: Principles of Biomedical Informatics
  author: Ira Kalet
  cover: pbi.jpg
  description: |

    [*Principles of Biomedical Informatics*][pobi] is a "pioneering technical
    work in biomedical informatics" that uses Common Lisp to implement various
    bioinformatics programs.

    From the [description][pobi-desc]:

    >Lisp is the main programing language in this edition, as in the first. It
    >is by far the best for achieving the goals of the book, to present
    >biomedical informatics as a systematic set of formal ideas and methods that
    >are naturally expressed as computations on well-defined representations. In
    >Chapter 1, the basic ideas of symbolic computing are introduced gradually
    >as needed. The Appendix has been expanded to include more tutorial material
    >as well as references to aid the reader who is not so familiar with Lisp.

- title: Common Lisp Recipes

  description: |
    [*Common Lisp Recipes*](http://weitz.de/cl-recipes/) is a book
    every Common Lisper should keep within arm's reach.

    From the author's description:

    >**Common Lisp Recipes** is a collection of solutions to problems
    >and answers to questions you are likely to encounter when writing
    >real-world applications in Common Lisp. Written by an author who
    >has used Common Lisp in many successful commercial projects over
    >more than a decade, this book covers areas as diverse as web
    >programming, databases, graphical user interfaces, integration
    >with other programming languages, multi-threading, and mobile
    >devices as well as debugging techniques and optimization, to name
    >just a few. It is also the first Common Lisp book to tackle such
    >advanced topics as environment access, logical pathnames, Gray
    >streams, delivery of executables, pretty printing, setf
    >expansions, or changing the syntax of Common Lisp.

    >**Common Lisp Recipes** is written in a style that mixes hands-on,
    >no frills pragmatism with precise information and prudent
    >mentorship.
