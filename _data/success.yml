        Piano is a complete aircraft analysis suite from [Lissys Ltd][site].

        >Piano is a powerful commercial tool with an established user base of major
        >airframe and aero-engine manufacturers, research and governmental institutions,
        >and environmental organisations worldwide. Originally written in Macintosh
        >Common Lisp, Piano has recently been ported to LispWorks and the user interface
        >is now implemented using LispWorks CAPI graphical toolkit. The cross-platform
        >capability of LispWorks proved to be an invaluable strength. The highly
        >professional LispWorks team impressed Lissys from the start by rapidly
        >prototyping some examples demonstrating the feasibility of such a complex
        >transfer. The actual port was then carried out through Clozure Associates in a
        >timeframe significantly better than our early expectations and resulting in a
        >very stable final product.
        >
        >Since the inception of Piano in the early 1990s, Lissys has used Lisp to
        >support rapid development. The malleability of the language was a key factor
        >when integrating the multifaceted and interdisciplinary aspects of aircraft
        >project analysis.
        >
        >The flexibility of LispWorks also allowed us to create two separate tools, one
        >that is fully-featured and largely intended for aeronautical engineers
        >(Piano-5), and one that is freely downloadable and is addressed to a broader
        >audience of anyone interested in aircraft evaluation with an emphasis on
        >environmental emissions (Piano-X). A critical requirement for Piano-X was to
        >provide a clean and simple interface on top of some highly complex underlying
        >methods, a task that both LispWorks and Clozure handled admirably.
        >
        >In our experience, the straightforward licensing approach and technical
        >professionalism of LispWorks stand out in the complex landscape of software
        >development and create a highly effective combination.

      description: |
        Raytheon has built SigLab, a Common Lisp platform for signal processing
        used in missile defense.

        It combines high-performance FFTs and composable signal processing components.

          >The screenshot shows our SigLab system running a simulation of an
          >incoming nuclear warhead (all exo-atmospheric), and at 40 seconds
          >into the run you see in the middle left 2-D Sonogram display the
          >effects of a nearby warhead exploding and heating up the target being
          >tracked. This analysis was used at Raytheon to develop advanced rapid
          >detection and discrimination systems for targeting incoming nuclear
          >warheads on our [EKV project][ekv] (Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle).
