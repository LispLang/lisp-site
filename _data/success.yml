      description: |
        Piano is a complete aircraft analysis suite from [Lissys Ltd][site].

        >Piano is a powerful commercial tool with an established user base of major
        >airframe and aero-engine manufacturers, research and governmental institutions,
        >and environmental organisations worldwide. Originally written in Macintosh
        >Common Lisp, Piano has recently been ported to LispWorks and the user interface
        >is now implemented using LispWorks CAPI graphical toolkit. The cross-platform
        >capability of LispWorks proved to be an invaluable strength. The highly
        >professional LispWorks team impressed Lissys from the start by rapidly
        >prototyping some examples demonstrating the feasibility of such a complex
        >transfer. The actual port was then carried out through Clozure Associates in a
        >timeframe significantly better than our early expectations and resulting in a
        >very stable final product.
        >
        >Since the inception of Piano in the early 1990s, Lissys has used Lisp to
        >support rapid development. The malleability of the language was a key factor
        >when integrating the multifaceted and interdisciplinary aspects of aircraft
        >project analysis.
        >
        >The flexibility of LispWorks also allowed us to create two separate tools, one
        >that is fully-featured and largely intended for aeronautical engineers
        >(Piano-5), and one that is freely downloadable and is addressed to a broader
        >audience of anyone interested in aircraft evaluation with an emphasis on
        >environmental emissions (Piano-X). A critical requirement for Piano-X was to
        >provide a clean and simple interface on top of some highly complex underlying
        >methods, a task that both LispWorks and Clozure handled admirably.
        >
        >In our experience, the straightforward licensing approach and technical
        >professionalism of LispWorks stand out in the complex landscape of software
        >development and create a highly effective combination.

    - title: Missile Defense at Raytheon
      description: |
        Raytheon has built SigLab, a Common Lisp platform for signal processing
        used in missile defense.

        It combines high-performance FFTs and composable signal processing components.

        >By leveraging decades of experience across several kill vehicle
        >programs and vast tactical weapon expertise across every domain and
        >mission area, we’re meeting the critical needs of today and planning
        >for the threats of tomorrow.

        >Raytheon is the only company working simultaneously on four kill
        >vehicles, providing a pipeline of crucial lessons learned and
        >laboratories and factories teeming with experts whose knowledge is
        >irreplaceable. Pioneering the nation’s early kinetic warhead
        >development provided Raytheon the expertise to evolve the way kill
        >vehicles are produced, tested, deployed, and ultimately how they
        >perform to defend the United States and its allies. The company is
        >building upon this legacy of expertise to revolutionize the role that
        >kill vehicles play in missile defense.

    - title: pgloader
      description: |
        [pgloader][pg] is a bulk importer for PostgreSQL. It can import data from MySQL,
        SQLite or dBase databases and CSV files, automatically identify schemas, and
        does everything asynchronously.

        Migrate from MySQL to PostgreSQL. In one command.
        : Given a MySQL connection string, pgloader query the catalogs to list your
          tables, constraints and indexes and know how to transform this schema into a
          PostgreSQL equivalent, applying advanced casting rules that you can edit in
          the command.

        Load any CSV file. Real quick.
        : The current version of pgloader is up to ten times faster than the previous
          one. The new command syntax is really powerful, and as it's different enough
          from the previous version, pgloader includes a command line switch to upgrade
          your setup for you.

        Transform your data. While streaming.
        : pgloader includes reformating modules allowing you to reformat your data, such
          as transforming a couple of integer columns into a single ip address, or a
          couple of floats into a single point. Of course, you can add any
          transformation you like and easily get to use it with pgloader loading your
          code!
