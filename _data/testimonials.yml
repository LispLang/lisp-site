      At Grammarly, the foundation of our business, our core grammar engine, is
      written in Common Lisp. It currently processes more than a thousand
      sentences per second, is horizontally scalable, and has reliably served in
      production for almost 3 years.

      Lisp was the natural language to start with. We needed to write lots of
      code very quickly; and we needed the higher-level power that only Lisp and
      Allegro CL provides. Lisp provided us with the ability to write the
      algorithms that we needed.

      We can search thousands of pricing and scheduling options in the time it
      takes the other airline engines to search several hundred. And, thanks to
      our lisp-based algorithms, we can adapt our questions to become more
      narrow or broad depending on the situation.
