## Travis CI

[Travis][travis] is a service for running unit tests in the cloud. Every commit
you make and every pull request your project receives is seen by Travis, which
spins up a [Docker][docker] container and runs your tests. With a little work,
it supports Common Lisp.

Travis is controlled by a file in your repo's root, `.travis.yml`. It defines
some options, like the `language` the project is written in, the list of shell
commands that have to be executed prior to running the tests, and whom to send
notifications to.

YAML is an easy to read format for structured data. Tools like
[Ansible][ansible], [Chef][chef] and [Salt][salt] have made it popular for
configuration management and deployment. The result is basically a shell script,
but structured into different sections.

To test a Common Lisp project, we use [cl-travis][cl-travis]. This provides a
script that you can tell Travis to download, which sets up the Common Lisp
implementation of your choice (you can test on many -- more on that below), and
installs [Quicklisp][quicklisp].

Without further ado, this is what the simplest `.travis.yml` looks like:

~~~yaml
language: common-lisp
sudo: required

env:
  matrix:
    - LISP=sbcl
    - LISP=ccl

install:
  # Install cl-travis
  - curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luismbo/cl-travis/master/install.sh | bash

script:
  - cl -l fiveam
       -e '(setf fiveam:*debug-on-error* t
                 fiveam:*debug-on-failure* t)'
       -e '(setf *debugger-hook*
                 (lambda (c h)
                   (declare (ignore c h))
                   (uiop:quit -1)))'
       -e '(ql:quickload :my-project-test)'

notifications:
  email:
    - my-email@gmail.com
~~~

The first two items just define the language of the project and tell it that
`sudo` is required to run the tests. `cl-travis` requires sudo, so we'll have to
set it to `required` at least for now.

Every item in the `env.matrix` list will create a new build with a certain
configuration of environment variables. In this case, we want to test on both
[SBCL][sbcl] and [CCL][ccl], so we use this:

~~~yaml
env:
  matrix:
    - LISP=sbcl
    - LISP=ccl
~~~

The `install` list is just a list of shell commands to execute to set up the
test environment. Here, we just download and install `cl-travis`:

~~~yaml
install:
  # Install cl-travis
  - curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luismbo/cl-travis/master/install.sh | bash
~~~

Projects which require system libraries to run the tests, like [Crane][crane],
can install and configure those in the `install` list:

~~~yaml
install:
  # Install cl-travis
  - curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luismbo/cl-travis/master/install.sh | bash
  # Install the latest versions of the major dependencies
  - git clone https://github.com/fukamachi/sxql.git quicklisp/local-projects/sxql
  - git clone https://github.com/fukamachi/cl-dbi.git quicklisp/local-projects/cl-dbi
  # Update package repos
  - sudo apt-get update
  # Install SQLite
  - sudo apt-get install -y sqlite3
  # Set up Postgres
  - sudo -u postgres createdb crane_test_db
  - sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER crane_test_user WITH PASSWORD 'crane_test_user'"
  - sudo -u postgres psql -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE crane_test_db TO crane_test_user"
~~~

For projects that you'd like to test using the latest version of dependencies,
you can clone them to the `~/lisp` folder. For instance, this is the `install`
list of the `.travis.yml` file for [Scriba][scriba]:

~~~yaml
install:
  # Install cl-travis
  - curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luismbo/cl-travis/master/install.sh | bash
  # Clone the latest common-doc
  - git clone https://github.com/CommonDoc/common-doc.git ~/lisp/common-doc
  # Clone the latest common-doc-plump
  - git clone https://github.com/CommonDoc/common-doc-plump.git ~/lisp/common-doc-plump
~~~

Finally, the `script` is the actual testing itself. `cl-travis` install
[CIM][cim], a command line utility for managing and running different Lisp
implementations under a common interface.

The `cl` command launches a Lisp image, and the `-l` flag can be used to
Quickload a library. The `-e` flag lets us execute code, and here's where we set
up what happens on failure and how to run the tests.

If you're using [FiveAM][fiveam] for testing, you need to tell it to enter the
debugger on test failures and errors. Then, hook up the debugger to
UIOP's[^uiop] implementation-independent `quit` function. This ensures that on a
test failure the script exits with `-1`, which tells Travis the tests have
failed. Then, we just Quickload the test system to run the tests:

~~~yaml
script:
  - cl -l fiveam
       -e '(setf fiveam:*debug-on-error* t
                 fiveam:*debug-on-failure* t)'
       -e '(setf *debugger-hook*
                 (lambda (c h)
                   (declare (ignore c h))
                   (uiop:quit -1)))'
       -e '(ql:quickload :my-project-test)'
~~~

If you're using fukamachi's [prove][prove] for testing, you use this:

~~~yaml
script:
    - cl -l prove -e '(or (prove:run :my-project-test) (uiop:quit -1))'
~~~

### Enabling Travis

To use Travis, you need to sign up with your GitHub account. Then hover over
your name in the upper right-hand corner of the page and go to your profile
page. This will give you the following page:

![Travis profile page](/assets/img/learn/travis/travis.png)

If you're just pushed the repo, chances are you need to click on 'Sync' to
update the list of repos.

Then you click on the switch next to the repo's name to enable it, and then all
you have to do is push a commit to trigger a build. Travis, like all services,
has its ups and downs in terms of availability. So some times builds will start
almost instantaneously, other times they'll take longer.


### Gitlab CI and Docker

[Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/README.html) is part of
Gitlab and is available on [Gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/), for
public and private repositories. Let's see straight away a simple
`.gitlab-ci.yml`:

~~~
image: daewok/lisp-devel

before_script:
  - apt-get update -qy
  - apt-get install -y git-core
  - git clone https://github.com/foo/bar ~/quicklisp/local-projects/

test:
  script:
    - make test
~~~

Gitlab CI is based on Docker. With `image` we tell it to use the
[daewok/lisp-devel](https://hub.docker.com/r/daewok/lisp-devel/)
one. It includes SBCL, ECL, CCL and ABCL, and Quicklisp is installed
in the home (`/home/lisp/`), so we can `quickload` packages right
away. If you're interested it also has a more bare bones option. Gitlab will load the
image, clone our project and put us at the project root with
administrative rights to run the rest of the commands.

`test` is a "job" we define, `script` is a
recognized keywords that takes a list of commands to run.

Suppose we must install dependencies before running our tests:
`before_script` will run before each job. Here we clone a library
where Quicklisp can find it, and for doing so we must install git
(Docker images are usually pretty bare bones).

We can try locally ourselves. If we already installed [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) and
started its daemon (`sudo service docker start`), we can do:

    docker run --rm -it -v /path/to/local/code:/usr/local/share/common-lisp/source daewok/lisp-devel:latest bash

This will download the lisp image (Â±400Mo), mount some local code in
the image where indicated, and drop us in bash. Now we can try a `make
test`.

To show you a more complete example:

~~~
image: daewok/lisp-devel

stages:
  - test
  - build

before_script:
  - apt-get update -qy
  - apt-get install -y git-core
  - git clone https://github.com/foo/bar ~/quicklisp/local-projects/

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - make test

build:
  stage: build
  only:
    - tags
  script:
    - make build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - some-file-name
~~~

Here we defined two `stages` (see
[environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/environments.html)),
"test" and "build", defined to run one after another. A "build" stage
will start only if the "test" one succeesds.

"build" is asked to run `only` when a
new tag is pushed, not at every commit. When it succeeds, it will make
the files listed in `artifacts`'s `paths` available for download. We can
download them from Gitlab's Pipelines UI, or with an url. This one will download
the file "some-file-name" from the latest "build" job:

    https://gitlab.com/username/project-name/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/some-file-name?job=build

When the pipelines pass, you will see:

You now have a ready to use Gitlab CI.

## Coverage Tracking

Code coverage is basically how many lines of source code are run by tests. SBCL
supports coverage measuring, and can generate some HTML reports of coverage, but
it requires some manual operation.

Enter [Coveralls][coveralls]: This is a service that takes raw code coverage
data and tracks it. It shows you covered files, which lines are executed and
which are not, the evolution of coverage over time, and also tells you what a
pull request will do to coverage.

Coveralls works with Travis, so now extra files are needed: You run the code
coverage in the Travis build, along with the tests, and send the data to
Coveralls for tracking. The library that does all this is
[cl-coveralls][cl-coveralls], which provides a macro that wraps some code in
coverage measuring.

To add Coveralls support to the `.travis.yml` file, we first set the `COVERALLS`
environment variable to `true` for a particular implementation (preferably
SBCL):

~~~yaml
env:
  matrix:
    - LISP=sbcl COVERALLS=true
    - LISP=ccl
~~~

Then, we clone `cl-coveralls`:

~~~yaml
install:
  # Coveralls support
  - git clone https://github.com/fukamachi/cl-coveralls ~/lisp/cl-coveralls
~~~

In the `script` part, we load coveralls along with our testing framework, and
then wrap the code that runs tests in the `with-coveralls` macro:

~~~yaml
script:
  - cl -l fiveam -l cl-coveralls
       -e '(setf fiveam:*debug-on-error* t
                 fiveam:*debug-on-failure* t)'
       -e '(setf *debugger-hook*
                 (lambda (c h)
                   (declare (ignore c h))
                   (uiop:quit -1)))'
       -e '(coveralls:with-coveralls (:exclude (list "t"))
             (ql:quickload :my-project-test))'
~~~

Note how we used the `:exclude` option to prevent testing code from falling into
coverage tracking.

### Enabling Coveralls

The process is similar to enabling a repo for Travis:

![Coveralls profile page](/assets/img/learn/travis/coveralls.png)

You flick the switch to enable or disable a repo, and if the repo is new, click
on 'Sync GitHub Repos' up there near the top of the page.

## Badges

Now, the whole point of this is letting users know what state the software is
in. Both Travis and Coveralls give each project a status badge, and image you
can put in the README to let users know upfront that the project's in working
order and what the coverage status is.

Here's the Markdown for Travis and Coveralls badges:

~~~markdown
# Project Name

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/USER/REPO.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/USER/REPO)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/USER/REPO/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/USER/REPO?branch=master)
