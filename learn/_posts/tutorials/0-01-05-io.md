## Format

The most common way to print data to the screen is using the `format`
function. This is like C's `printf`, but embedding a whole language for
printing.

This [chapter][pcl-chap] of [*Practical Common Lisp*][pcl] contains a lot of
useful `format` directives.

## File I/O

You can use `with-open-file` to safely handle files.

For instance, here's how we open a file `data.txt` in your home directory for
writing:

```lisp
(with-open-file (stream (merge-pathnames #p"data.txt"
                                         (user-homedir-pathname))
                        :direction :output    ;; Write to disk
                        :if-exists :supersede ;; Overwrite the file
                        :if-does-not-exist :create)
  (dotimes (i 100)
    ;; Write random numbers to the file
    (format stream "~3,3f~%" (random 100))))
```

You can read the file into a string using `uiop:read-file-string`:

```lisp
CL-USER> (uiop:read-file-string (merge-pathnames #p"data.txt"
                                                 (user-homedir-pathname)))
"44.000
95.000
5.000
97.000
...
15.000"
```
